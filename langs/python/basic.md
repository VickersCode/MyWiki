### Print statements are great for debugging
```python
print("Hello World")
```
Gotta stick with the cliche.

### Comment using '#'

```python
# This is a comment
This is not a comment
```

For multiline comments, '#' is still used for each line. But we can use triple quotes, like so
```python
"""
This is 
a multiline
comment
"""
```
