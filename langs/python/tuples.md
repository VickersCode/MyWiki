## Intro

Tuples are like a list, except they are immutable and ordered. Duplicate values and multiple value types are allowed.

If declaring a tuple with one item, python will only recognize it as a tuple if there is a comma after the item.
`thisTuple = ("John",)`

#### Constructor
```python
myTuple = tuple((1,2,3))
# Yes, the double brackets are necessary
```

`len()` determines number of entries
`count()` returns instances of a specific value
`index()` returns the index of a value
