## Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform mathematical computations

| Operator | What it do     | Example |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| +        | Addition       | x + y   |
| -        | Subtraction    | x - y   |
| *        | Multiplication | x * y   |
| /        | Division       | x / y   |
| %        | Modulus        | x % y   |
| **       | Exponentiation | x ** y  |
| //       | Floor division | x // y  |

## Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables

| Operator | Example | Same As    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| =        | x = 5   | x = 5      |
| +=       | x += 3  | x = x + 3  |
| -=       | x -= 3  | x = x - 3  |
| *=       | x *= 3  | x = x * 3  |
| /=       | x /= 3  | x = x / 3  |
| %=       | x %= 3  | x = x % 3  |
| //=      | x //= 3 | x = x // 3 |
| **=      | x **= 3 | x = x ** 3 |
| &=       | x &= 3  | x = x & 3  |
| \|=      | x \|= 3 | x = x \| 3 |
| ^=       | x ^= 3  | x = x ^ 3  |
| >>=      | x >>= 3 | x = x >> 3 |
| <<=      | x <<= 3 | x = x << 3 |
Operators like `x += 3` are a quicker way of writing `x = x + 3`
